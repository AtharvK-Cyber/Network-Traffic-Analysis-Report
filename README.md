# PROFESSIONAL NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS REPORT

---

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this network traffic analysis was to perform a structured examination of the packet capture file, **`Task5.pcap`**. The analysis sought to identify and classify the core network protocols in use, determine the communication flows, and uncover any security-relevant observations or anomalies within the captured data. This report fulfills the deliverable requirements with a professional, detailed, and academically suitable presentation.

## 2. Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Wireshark** | The principal network protocol analyzer utilized for packet capture, deep inspection, filtering, and session reconstruction. |
| **Active Network Interface** | The endpoint used for the initial live packet capture, providing the raw dataset. |
| **VMware** | To keep Some things confidintial I Used Virtual Parrot os. |

## 3. Methodology

The network capture was executed following controlled procedures to generate a representative dataset for security analysis:

1.  **Wireshark Installation & Configuration:** The network protocol analyzer was successfully installed and prepared for capture.
2.  **Interface Selection:** The active network interface was selected to monitor all data traffic.
3.  **Traffic Generation:** Deliberate traffic was generated by browsing multiple domains, including security-testing platforms (`testphp.vulnweb.com`), and attempting simulated login/form submissions. This activity ensured the capture included a mix of both routine and application-specific communications.
4.  **Capture Termination:** The capture was stopped after approximately 1-2 minutes to focus the analysis on the generated activity.
5.  **Analysis and Filtering:** Display filters (e.g., `http`, `dns`, `tcp.flags.syn==1`) were applied within Wireshark to systematically isolate and analyze key protocols and communication stages.

## 4. Traffic Overview

The **`Task5.pcap`** file contains a focused mix of traffic, dominated by web browsing activities and the foundational network processes required to support them.

| Traffic Category | Dominant Protocols | Example Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Application** | HTTP, HTTPS (TLS), OCSP, TCP | Web page requests, form submissions, security certificate validation. |
| **Name Resolution** | DNS, UDP | Translating hostnames (e.g., `www.vx-underground.org`) to IP addresses. |
| **Local Discovery** | SSDP, UDP | Multicast announcements for discovering local UPnP devices. |
| **Session Control** | TCP | Connection establishment (Three-Way Handshake) and termination. |

## 5. Protocol Analysis

### 5.1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **Definition:** A **connection-oriented** transport layer protocol providing **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** data stream delivery.
* **Usage in Capture:** Serves as the fundamental transport for all high-level application protocols observed (HTTP, HTTPS, OCSP). Its function is evidenced by the mandatory **three-way handshake** (`SYN`, `SYN-ACK`, `ACK`) at the start of every connection.
* **Example Fields:** Source/Destination Ports (e.g., `80`, `443`); Control Flags (`SYN`, `ACK`, `FIN`).

### 5.2. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **Definition:** A **connectionless** transport layer protocol prioritizing speed over reliability.
* **Usage in Capture:** Exclusively used by protocols where low overhead and speed are critical, such as **DNS** queries and **SSDP** multicast messages.

### 5.3. HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)

* **Definition:** The application protocol for the World Wide Web. **HTTPS** is HTTP encapsulated within an encrypted **TLS/SSL** tunnel.
* **Usage in Capture:**
    * **HTTP (Port 80):** Used for fetching resources and, critically, for transmitting user form data.
    * **HTTPS (Port 443):** Its presence is confirmed by the numerous **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)** requests used to validate certificate revocation status for secure connections.
* **Example Fields (HTTP POST):** Request Method (`POST /userinfo.php`); Host (`testphp.vulnweb.com`); HTTP Status Code (`200 OK`).

### 5.4. DNS (Domain Name System)

* **Definition:** The protocol used to translate domain names into IP addresses.
* **Usage in Capture:** Essential traffic observed immediately preceding web connections to resolve target hostnames.
* **Example Domains:** Resolution attempts for `www.vx-underground.org`, `testphp.vulnweb.com`, and external OCSP servers.

### 5.5. ICMP & ARP

* **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for network diagnostics (e.g., `ping`) and error reporting. It is implicitly required for network health, though not a dominant application traffic type in this capture.
* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** A link-layer protocol necessary to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses for local network communication. It is fundamental for establishing any local connection.

## 6. Insights and Observations

The analysis yielded two highly significant security observations directly related to the user's interaction with the target web application:

### A. Critical Finding: Plaintext Credential Exposure (CWE-319)

**Observation:** A **`POST`** request destined for `testphp.vulnweb.com/userinfo.php` was transmitted over **unencrypted HTTP (TCP Port 80)**.

**Evidence:** The packet body explicitly contained the login attempt parameters: **`uname=test&pass=test`**.

**Impact:** The credentials **`test:test`** were exposed in clear, readable text. This represents a critical violation of data confidentiality, allowing any party passively monitoring the network traffic to compromise the user's account. This finding underscores the necessity of enforcing **HTTPS** for all data submission, regardless of perceived sensitivity.

### B. Security Anomaly: Suspected SQL Injection (SQLi) Probe (CWE-89)

**Observation:** A subsequent `POST` request to the same user information endpoint contained non-standard and suspicious input values.

**Evidence:** The form field labeled `urname` contained the string **`1%7D`** (decoded as **`1}`**), a pattern often used by attackers or testers to terminate a string and inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query.

**Impact:** This traffic signature strongly suggests a deliberate **penetration test** or adversarial attempt to probe the application's input sanitization controls for a **SQL Injection vulnerability**.

### C. Summary of Communication Flow

The capture demonstrates a standard, yet insecure, communication life cycle:
1.  **DNS resolution** establishes the target IP.
2.  **TCP Handshake** initiates the connection.
3.  **HTTP Request** sends the data.
4.  **Insecure Transmission** occurs due to lack of encryption.
5.  **Session Cookie** (`Set-Cookie: login=test%2Ftest`) is issued, confirming a successful, albeit flawed, session establishment.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The analysis of **`Task5.pcap`** successfully categorized all major network protocols and provided profound security insights. The capture serves as a textbook example of poor security hygiene in application development, demonstrating the clear transmission of **plaintext credentials** and the presence of traffic indicating an attempted **SQL Injection** attack.

This exercise verifies the analyst's capability in identifying network protocols and extracting critical security intelligence from raw packet data, confirming the essential role of network traffic analysis in comprehensive cybersecurity practice.
